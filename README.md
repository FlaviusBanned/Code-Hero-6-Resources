### Code Hero 5 - Python OOP Resources 🐍🚀

Welcome to the **Code Hero 5 Resources** repository! 🎉

This collection features the materials I used to teach **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python to students in grades 5-12 during **Code Hero 5**. The aim was to introduce young minds to the world of OOP in a fun and interactive way.

The resources are designed to be beginner-friendly, making it easier for students to grasp core OOP concepts while building confidence in writing Python code. 💡

📂 **What's Inside?**

  -> **📜 Lesson Notes** – Clear and structured explanations of OOP concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, and more.

  -> **💻 Code Examples** – Practical examples that demonstrate how to implement OOP principles in Python.

  -> **📝 Exercises & Challenges** – Engaging practice problems to reinforce learning and mastery of Python OOP.

  -> **🎮 Mini Projects** – Fun, hands-on coding tasks to apply OOP concepts in real-world scenarios.

⚠️ **Important Notice**

These materials are based on **Cartea Daliei**'s notes. Any attempt to use, distribute, or modify them without proper consent is strictly prohibited.
