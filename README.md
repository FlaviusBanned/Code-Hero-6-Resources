# Code Hero 6 - Python OOP Resources 🐍🚀

Welcome to the **Code Hero 6 Resources** repository! 🎉

This collection features the materials I used to teach **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python to students in grades 5-12 during **Code Hero 6**. The goal was to introduce young minds to the world of OOP in a fun and interactive way.

The resources are designed to be beginner-friendly, making it easier for students to grasp core OOP concepts while building confidence in writing Python code. 💡
